# Optimization (Optax / JAX-native)

Optimization examples that leverage differentiability:
- fitting geometry harmonics
- calibrating parameters against frozen Fortran fixtures
- end-to-end objective optimization (with publication-style plots in some scripts)

Examples:
- `fit_geometry_harmonics_with_optax.py`
- `calibrate_nu_n_to_fortran_residual_fixture.py`
